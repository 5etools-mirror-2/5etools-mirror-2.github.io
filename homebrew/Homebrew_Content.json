				"This small jar of slime fungus can be applied to a creature as an action.",
				"The slime quickly grows over the creature's skin, hardening into a pliable yet incredibly resilient chitin shell. The creature gains a natural armor AC calculation option of 16, and counts as being unarmored unless already wearing other armor. This shell does not impare movement, and its weight after application is negligible.",
				"The shell is magical in nature, and is very short lived after the vast amount of power expended to create the shell, lasting 10 minutes before it withers and dies, falling off the skin in flakes (while technically edible, these fungus flakes are less appealing than hard tack).",

On each of the subsequent days, the growth is pruned, enchanted, has fertilizers and such reapplied, and is generally pampered to grow in the desired manner. While in dim light, the growth grows at half the standard rate. If left in bright light for over 1 day, it dies, wasting spent ingredients.",
				"Once harvested, the light requirements become irrelevant as the enchantments laid upon it at harvest make it more resilient in addition to the glass of the usual jar blocking most of the harmful radiation from the light."
